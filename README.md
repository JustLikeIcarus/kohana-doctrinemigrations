- **Module Versions:** 0.8
- **Module URL:** <http://github.com/synapsestudios/kohana-doctrinemigrations>
- **Compatible Kohana Version(s):** 3.0

## Description

This module allows for managing database migrations between multiple
environments easily by utilizing the Doctrine migrations library.

## Requirements & Installation

**You should make sure to disable this module on your production environment!**

The Doctrine Migrations module is tested with Doctrine v1.2.2. You should run
`git submodule update --init` to load Doctrine into the vendor directory of this
module. Additionally, you should create a directory for your migration classes
that is located in your application directory (application/migrations/).

To run from the command line, execute this command from the directory that has
your index.php file: `php index.php --uri=doctrine/migrations`.  This will
run all database migrations up to the current version. You can optionally
include the version that you want to migrate up/down to like so:
`php index.php --uri=doctrine/migrations/14`.
